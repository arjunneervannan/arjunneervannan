### Hi there! I'm Arjun. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at The University of Pennsylvania's dual degree Management and Technology (M&T) Program, pursuing a B.S.E in Computer Science from the School of Engineering and B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School.

In the past, I've built an NLP-based toxic comment detection algorithm (check out my repository Toxic-Comment-Detection for more) and was selected to be a top 10 Regeneron STS Finalist for this project. Feel free to reach out to me at arjun02@wharton.upenn.edu!
